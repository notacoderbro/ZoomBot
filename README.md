Zoombot â€“ Automated Video Meeting AI by Hemant Mallah

# ZOOMBOT
Teachers get paid for doing shit on zoom with their cancer video quality and auto-tuned background noise.
As a student I definately want good grades, but the fucking education system wants 80% attendance.
And theres no way I'm gonna invest time in attending those "Zoom Lectures" Its meant for nerds ig.
So, inorder to reclaim my precious time, i made a digital twin of mine using AI.
It can listen and react to shitty questions like "roll no 56 did you get it?" with "yes"
And "I'm having trouble hearing you!" to questions which it doesn't understand.
Guess what, it even cycles through still shots of mine while speaking with choppy fashion, Definately I'm having internet issue!!

# Conclusion
Saved my precious time.
